KO annotation : 
Use BlastKOALA (Version 2.1, https://www.kegg.jp/blastkoala/) to annotate KO definitions for genes (~5k genes each time/batch). 
 Enter taxonomy group of your genome              : Using taxonomy ID : 3653  (Citrullus genus)
 Enter KEGG GENES database file to be searched    : genus_eukaryotes
 Enter your email address : sunhonghe_1984@163.com (Only one data could be run at the same time with the same email address).

Download KO_definition (details: "View"=>Download) from the resultant web-link. The output table's header is 'Gene_ID \t KO \t Definition \t Score \t Second-KO \t Second-Score'. 
Save "Reconstruct Pathway" webpage for pathway table construction. 

Reconstruct pathway : 
Use "KEGG Mapper â€“ Reconstruct Pathway" tool : https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway.html
Different 'KEGG Mapper' version may provides slightly different pathway mapping results, so I would like to recommand re-construct the maps at the same time for each analysis, and to record the 'KEGG Mapper' version used. 
 Input genelist.txt file : 
   format example : 
     geneID \t KO_ID 
     geneID \t KO_ID
     ...
